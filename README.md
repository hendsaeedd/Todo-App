## My process

A large part of this project was made with functional programming and DOM manipulations, I also implemented a little bit of OOP in creating the task lists, and this was so that i could easily track the number of active tasks by storing them in an array. And also so that I could easily give each task {object} it's own unique properties and identity.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Js
